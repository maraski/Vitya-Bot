Made with discord.js and sqlite libraries on top of node.js

### Usage

* Uhh. Make you have node.js installed
* Install discord.js package into your bot directory ```npm install discord.js```
* Also install sqlite ```npm install sqlite```
* vitya.js and config.json must be in the same directory as package.json (or package-lock.json).
* After you've done your edits to the bot and replaced the token in config
